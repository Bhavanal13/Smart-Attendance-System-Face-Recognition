Smart Attendance System – Face Recognition                                                  
Project Overview

The Smart Attendance System is an automated attendance management solution that uses face recognition and machine learning to identify individuals and record their attendance in real time. This system eliminates manual attendance processes, reduces proxy attendance, and improves accuracy and efficiency in academic or organizational environments.

The project leverages computer vision techniques to detect and recognize faces from live video streams or images and logs attendance with timestamps into a database or CSV file.

Objectives

Automate attendance tracking using facial recognition
Reduce manual effort and human errors
Prevent fake or proxy attendanc
Maintain digital attendance records
Provide a scalable and user-friendly solution

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks:
OpenCV (Image Processing & Face Detection)
Face Recognition / dlib (Face Encoding & Matching)
NumPy & Pandas (Data Handling)
